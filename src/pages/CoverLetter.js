        Greetings! I am Pedro, 22, from Brazil. I study Computer Engineering (at
        UFSC). Since I was a child I really liked to read and write in general.
        And with code, to understand what happens behind the curtain sd like a
        great idea, always. When I turned 18, I was spending a year in Czech
        Republic as an AFS exchange student. There, I improved a lot my English
        and Spanish language skills and learned czech quite well, too. During my
        lifetime, since I was very young, I remind starring at the mirror and
        having this weird sense of comprehending and feeling my own existence
        and consciousness. I think this was a very important ingredient to lead
        me where I've been now. A lot changed during my year in Europe. For
        example, I went vegetarian for over 3 years, and I come from a very very
        traditional meat/barbecue context (gaucho) but there's away more
        relevant thing about this, before I went to EU, I didn't eat any
        vegetarian food at all (except brazilian rice & beans and few fruits,
        french fries, wheat etc.). What actually happened to me in many stages
        since then, is that I became a 'bit' more self-aware and willing to deal
        with my comfort zone to do what felt right. What made me feel right,
        fair, peaceful, truth, confident, strong. Everyday! Or almost... It
        would be perfect if we could be the best 'version' of our self all the
        time, wouldn't it? Anyway, after I finished high school, I went
        backpacking here in South America. I met awesome people and places. In
        this trip, only hitchhiking I roamed over 10.000km. This experience
        brought another ingredient: feel alive! It's like the yeast to me. Since
        I started Engineering, I have also improved my surfing skills, as you
        can see at the end of my resume, there're cool tubes here sometimes.
        Getting barreled briefs all I wrote about dealing with comfort zone,
        awareness, feelings, comprehension, and about feeling alive. It's the
        craziest feeling I've ever had, I seriously think everyone should try. I
        really love surfing. I haven't yet completed my graduation, however, I
        am studying programming a lot since I decided to go back to programming,
        about a year and half ago, because I didn't code since I was ~16. I
        changed my course from Energy Engineering to Computering Engineering,
        which's available on the same campus. My personal focus became
        programming (mainly web dev, data science yet beginning) even when I
        should be studying to univerirsty tests (like now hah) because my course
        is quite focused on hardware and low-level software, which is not my
        main focus. I see many opportunities within great contexts, with culture
        and the life quality expressed by respect, freedom and equality. My
        point of view to life may give you an idea that I commit with effort and
        focus into what I want to work on/learn/improve. I'm looking for job
        opportunities, to work with cool projects and people. I really need a
        job and Engineering may be on the background if I get a job with 30+
        assigned hours per week. I can realocate too. I'm very resilient and
        able to work off my comfort zone easily, no doubt. Not if I'm talking to
        a crowd of people that I don't know, which can make me look uncomfy...
        I'm not the native panelist guy you know, but I may work on it, and I'm
        sure I will, whenever I need to discourse often. I'm not yet a pro, on
        anything, but I'm pretty sure that I'll be, and that my first Tech job
        will play a big role on this path. Until now, all I developed was as a
        freelancer or student. The only jobs I had something like bosses were on
        restaurants, but since I'm a child I have discipline. I can also
        translate content among the languages I speak if you need
        (PT[BR]--EN--ES--CZ) . I'm a calm and easygoing person. But I guarantee
        that I may learn, in a couple months to get the experience you express
        in number of years, working on the stack you need (I can learn fast). I
        really love just to be alive, and I like to work with people who are
        also living in this high frequency and don’t get too attached to their
        own ideas/trues/p.o.v., because naturally and fortunately everyone may
        have their own, and it’s way too bad to suppress diverisity, in almost
        any context! I’m able to learn and work, with a lot of energy! If it's
        in your interest, let's get in touch. Thanks for reading! At.te, Pedro
